# ðŸŽ§ Spotify Discover GPT 

In this app, we connect streamlit to the Spotify API and provide controls for searching and getting recommendations for a selected playlist with advanced controls such as:
- Viewing audio feature metadata like tempo, genre, etc.
- Controlling recommendation parameters for attributes like tempo, genre, etc.

In the next iteration, we will use LangChain to automate searching/getting recommedations outside of specifying via visual controls by using natural language queries to convert to proper function inputs.
